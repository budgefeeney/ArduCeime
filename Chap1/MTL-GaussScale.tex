\subsubsection{Gaussian Scale Mixtures}
In the previous section we described how, essentially, a Laplace prior on a covariance can be used to introduce sparsity. An alternative to the Laplace distribution which has been the subject of some research in multi-task learning is the use of a Gaussian scale mixture. A common example of the Gaussian scale mixture is the Gaussian-Gamma mix, which is equivalent to the Student-T distribution:

\begin{align}
u & \sim \mathcal{G}\left(\halve{\nu}, \halve{\nu} \right) ,
& \vv{z}|u \sim \nor{\vv{\mu}}{\nu \inv{\Sigma}} 
& \implies & \vv{z} & \sim \mathcal{S}\left(\vv{\mu}, \inv{\Sigma}, \nu \right)
\end{align}

This simplifies inference using Student-T distributions considerably, as one can use the EM algorithm and treat $u$ as a latent variable. As the Student-T distribution has ``heavier" tails than the Gaussian, it is more accommodating of outliers, and so Student-T distributions, using this framework, have been used for ``robust" PCA and CCA\cite{Archambeau2006a}, and also robust matrix factorization\cite{Balaji2011}.

With regard to sparse solutions, it was shown in \cite{Figueiredo2003} that if one places a Gaussian-Exponential prior on each dimension of a weight vectors $\vv{w}_f \sim \nor{0}{\alpha_f}$ and places an exponential prior on the variance $\tau_f \sim \mathcal{E}\left(\gamma\right)$ then the marginal distribution over $w_f$ is a zero-mean Laplace distribution, where $\gamma$ controls the degree of sparsity. A different approach to sparsity was taken by \cite{Archambeau2009a} which, inspired by automatic relevance-determination (ARD), used a different Gaussian-Gamma mix on every individual component of a matrix $W \in \MReal{L}{F}$ of the form
\begin{align}
w_{ij} &\sim \nor{0}{\alpha_{ij}} & \alpha_{ij} \sim \mathcal{G}\left(\frac{a}{LF}, b\right)
\end{align}
Unlike the previous presentation, this does not automatically correspond to any known distribution. If one sets $a=0$ the marginal over $w_{ij}$ is the Laplace distribution, while the marginal approaches a Normal-Jeffry's prior as both $a$ and $b$ approach zero. Finally, if $\frac{a}{LF} = b$ then we recover a product of student-T distributions, which is also sharply peaked around zero and so sparsity inducing. The posterior distribution over the $\alpha_{ij}$ is a produce of generalised inverse Gaussian distributions.


The idea of Gaussian-Scale priors over covariances for multi-task learning was first employed in \cite{Archambeau2011}. This followed the same outline as multi-task GPs\cite{Bonilla2008} introduced earlier, but did not marginalize out the weights, taking a parametric view instead. The model featured a covariance over features where sparsity was induced by a Gaussian scale prior and a low-rank covariance over tasks estimated using the pPCA framework, which jointly formed the matrix-variate distribution over the weight matrix $W \in \MReal{L}{F}$. The model used block-level rather than element-level sparsity, so W was decomposed into submatrices $W_i$. Finally a generalised inverse Gaussian (GIG) distribution was used in the \emph{prior} Gaussian-Scale mixture. As a result, the marginal prior distribution over the weight matrix -- depending on its inferred parameterisation -- could be a matrix-variate Laplace, Student-T or Gamma distribution. The identifiability issues caused by the Kronecker matrix were dealt with using priors. The full model was therefore:

\begin{align}
\vv{t}_n|W,\vv{x}_n & \sim \nor{W\vv{x}_n}{\sigma^2 I_L} &
V & \sim \mnor{0}{\tau I_L}{I_Q} \\
W_i | V, Z_i, \Omega_i,\alpha_i & \sim \mnor{VZ_i}{\alpha_i^{-1} \Omega_i}{I_L} &
\Omega_i & \sim \mathcal{W}^{-1}\left(\nu, \lambda I_F \right) \\
Z_i | \Omega_i & \sim \mnor{0}{\alpha_i^{-1} \Omega_i}{I_Q} &
\alpha_i & \sim\mathcal{N}^{-1}\left(\omega, \chi, \phi\right)
\end{align}

Where $Q \ll L$ is the size of the low-rank task space, and $\mathcal{N}^{-1}\left(\omega, \chi, \phi\right)$ denotes the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution with PDF
\begin{align}
p(\alpha_i) = \frac{\chi^{-\omega}\left(\sqrt{\chi \phi}\right)^\omega}{2 K_w \left(\sqrt{\chi \phi}\right)} \alpha_i^{\omega-1} e^{-\half \chi \alpha_i^{-1} + \phi \alpha_i}
\end{align}
with $K_w(\cdot)$ being a modified Bessel function of the second kind. Inference, using variational EM, is complex, with gradient based methods required to learn the parameters of the GIG distribution.

This model was in turn extended in \cite{Yang2011} who defined a \emph{matrix-variate} generalised inverse Gaussian (MGIG) distribution $G\sim \mathcal{MGIG}\left(\Psi, \Phi, \nu\right), G \in \MReal{F}{F}$
\begin{align}
\frac{|G|^{\omega - (F + 1)/2}}{|\half \Psi|^\omega K_\omega \left(\frac{1}{4}\Phi \Psi\right)} \text{etr}\left( -\half \Psi \inv{G} - \half \Phi G \right)
\end{align}
where $K_\omega(\cdot)$ is a matrix-variate Bessel function. The Wishart and inverse-Wishart distributions are a special case of the MGIG distribution. They used this in a Gaussian-scale mixture to create a Gaussian MGIG (GMGIG) prior over weights.
\begin{align}
W & \sim \mnor{VZ}{\Omega}{\Sigma} &
V & \sim \mnor{V_0}{\kappa_v I_P}{\Sigma} &
Z & \sim \mnor{Z_0}{\Omega}{\kappa_z I_P} \\
\Omega & \sim \mathcal{MGIG}\left( \Psi_\Omega, \Phi_\Omega, \nu_\Omega \right) &
\Sigma & \sim \mathcal{MGIG}\left( \Psi_\Sigma, \Phi_\Sigma, \nu_\Sigma \right) &
\end{align}
which as can be seen, is a prior that assumes W is of low rank, with latent features $P \ll F$. Like the GIG prior of \cite{Archambeau2011} prior is similarly flexible, encompassing matrix-variate Student-T, Laplace and Bessel distributions. As before, identifiability is weakly enforced using priors, and in experiments they demonstrate better predictive performance versus the block-sparsifying GIG model.

It is worth re-iterating that Gaussian-Scale mixtures are not the only way of inducing sparsity. A considerably simpler approach was employed in \cite{Zhang2010a} for example, which simply added L1 matrix norm terms to the log-likelihood of a model using a matrix-variate prior with separate covariances, and then derived MLE estimates for the covariances in a ``flip-flop" style algorithm with the usual adjustments for identifiability.
