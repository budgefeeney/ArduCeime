Hello everyone
I'd just like to express, on behalf of Kathleen, Helen, and myself, our gratitude to you all, for being with us here today. We're aware that many of you have had to travel from some distance; and we hope to see you all in the Kingsley hotel later this afternoon. 

I'm speaking today because there have been many people who have thanked us in the past few months, and we would like to express our gratitude to them here today.

During his illness, Dad was treated by Dr. Khan, Dr. Bird –who had previously treated Helen when she was ill – and Professor O'Brien. They, and their teams at the Mater, Bons Secours, and Marymount Hospitals, were always kind and considerate, and made a great effort to help Dad during his illness.

In particular we would like to thank the staff and volunteers at Marymount Hospice: the doctors, the, nurses, and even NAME the shopkeeper who sold Dad his papers every morning. A hospice can never feel like home, but they did their best to make it as homely as possible, and to make Dad -- and us, his family -- feel as welcome as possible. They were a great support to us.

So too were all the friends and family who visited us regularly over the last few months. It meant a huge amount to Dad that so many people came to visit, people he'd known through climbing with Cork Mountaineers and the Coconut climbers, people he'd known through work at Rehab, and even people he'd known from the Rambling club in Castlebar forty years ago. He was deeply touched, and it hugely boosted his self-esteem, that so many people from such diverse parts of his life came to say hello, and reminisce about times past.

We too benefitted from the many kindnesses friends and family offered, be they gifts of cooked dinners and cakes, or help with the garden, where Dad’s unwavering passion for gardening kept me busy for much of October. 

We still benefit, and draw strength from your presence here today. We would like to thank Geraldine -- one of Dad's oldest friends, who came here today from Castlebar -- for her lovely reflection. We would also like to thank Fr. Cristeóir for his deeply touching sermon, and his attentiveness to our family in the preceding weeks and months. _a white lie_
