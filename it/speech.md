## Take 2

Before we part today, I'd just like to say a few words, on behalf of Kathleen, Helen and myself, to express our gratitude to those that have helped us over the last few months.

First and foremost, I would like to thank you, for being with us here today. Your presence here is not just a comfort to us; it is a wonderful testament to the man that my father was and to life he led. Hopefully we will get to see you all, and talk to you all, when we meet at the Kingsley Hotel at X o'clock.

We are grateful, too, to the medical teams at the Mater, Bons Secours and Marymount hospitals, led by Dr. Khan, Dr. Bird and Professor O'Brien. We particularly would like to thank the staff and volunteers at Marymount. Their dedication and care surpassed our expectations. They created a warm, welcome and homely environment where Dad could spend as comfortable and happy a time as we could wished.

We also thank the friends and family who visited us regularly. It meant a huge amount to Dad that so many people came to visit: people he'd known through climbing with the Cork, Bishopstown and Coconut hiking clubs; people he'd worked with at the Rehab Group; and even people he'd known from the rambling club in Castlebar forty years ago. It deeply touched and impressed him, that so many people from such diverse parts of his life came to say hello, and reminisce about times past. 

[FIXME: Nothing on _card senders_]

We, too, benefited from these visits by our friends and family. More than the welcome gifts of food and cake, we were comforted by the knowledge that we were surrounded by people willing and eager to help us.

We would like to thank thos people who have helped us today with our service: Geraldine for her lovely reflection; Úna & Aisling for their beautiful music; and Fr. Cristeóir for his touching sermon, and for his attentiveness to our family in the preceding weeks.

Dad was a man of many achievements. In his early life in Castlebar, growing up in a house with small back yard, he wandering around Mayo with Fr. Charlies Climbing Club; and started work straightaway as a clerk at the local factory when he turned 18.

Fifty year later, he was growing his own vegetables in his own garden; he had climbed mountains all over the world, even the 19,000 foot peak of Kilimanjaro; and -- of course -- he had documented all these travels with camera. He had managed hundreds of people with the Rehab group, and been introduced to the President of Ireland. And during all this he found time to study graduate with a Masters Degree in XXXX.

Yet perhaps his greatest achievement was in all the lives he touched in his time with us. We miss him dearly, but looking around at all you who have supported us, and are here to commemorate his passing with us, we can be sure his memory will never be forgotten.
