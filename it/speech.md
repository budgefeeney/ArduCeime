Hello everyone

On behalf of Kathleen, Helen, and myself, I would like to thank you all for being with us here today. We're aware that many of you have had to travel from some distance, and we hope to see you all later this afternoon at the Kingsley Hotel.

 * It is bcause we feel a need to express our gratitude to the many many people who helped us that I am speaking to you hear today.

 * I'm speaking to you here today, to express our gratitude to all the people that helped Dad, Kathleen, Helen and I over the last few months.

First, we must think Dr. Khan, Dr. Bird and Professor O'Brien, who treated Dad during his illness. We truly appreciate all that they and their teams at the Mater, Bons Secours, and Marymount Hospitals, were did to make Dad comfortable. 

In particular we would like to thank the staff and volunteers at Marymount Hospice, for creating a second home for Dad, where he he could buy his paper, go to mass, and chat with the staff about climbing and the latest news in Cork. It was a huge comfort to us that he could live in such such a happy, inclusive, environment.

We also wish to thank the friends and family who visited us regularly. It meant a huge amount to Dad that so many people came to visit: people he'd known through climbing with the Cork, Bishopstown and Coconut hiking clubs; people he'd known through work at the Rehab Group; and even people he'd known from the Rambling club in Castlebar forty years ago. It deeply touched and impressed him, that so many people from such diverse parts of his life came to say hello, and reminisce about times past. 

We, too, benefitted from the many kindnesses that our friends and family offered, be they gifts of cooked dinners and cakes, or help with the garden, which Dad never stopped tending to.

We still benefit, and draw strength, from your presence here today. We would like to thank Geraldine Grennell, for her lovely reflection; Úna Long-McDonagh for her beautiful music; and Fr. Cristeóir for his touching sermon, and his attentiveness to our family in the preceding weeks.

Looking through our photo albums, the earliest photo found of my Dad was of him aged 11 with his dog. It was taken by a friend; Dad didn't own a camera back then, and lived in a house with no garden. He did hiked though: he walked all 'round the local hills with Fr. Charlies's Climbing Club; and kept walking in Ireland and the Netherlands, even after he started working, at 18 years of age. He hadn't had the chance to pursue a degree, but had a plan to do so. 

By his sixty-eighth year he was growing his own fruit and vegetables in his own garden; he had hiked all round the world, taking thousands of photos with his treasured camera to add to his collection. He had even climbed Kilimanjaro as a retirement present to himself. He had had a career that saw him manage hundreds of people with the Rehab Group, and introduce them to the President of Ireland; and in between all this he had earned himself a Master of Science degree from UCC.

Yet perhaps his greatest achievement was in all the lives he touched in his time with us. We miss him dearly, but looking around at all you who have supported us, and are here to commemorate his passing, we can be sure his memory will live on.

Thank you.
